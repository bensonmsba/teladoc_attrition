Teladoc Health Employee Attrition Analysis with Python

【Project Summary】

To uncover the underlying factors driving employee departures and to minimize the financial impact of attrition, we leveraged two years of company data for an in-depth analysis. By constructing comprehensive charts and predictive models that consider variables such as employee tenure, department affiliation, and promotion history, we identified crucial determinants of employee retention. These insights serve as a valuable foundation for decision-making by the data and human resources departments, enabling targeted strategies to enhance employee satisfaction and loyalty.



【Responsibilities and Results】

1. Created over 20 insightful data visualizations using Python's Matplotlib library and built predictive machine learning models to identify the critical factors influencing employee retention decisions at Teladoc Health.
2. Prepared comprehensive analysis reports and presentations proposing key factors affecting employee turnover and recommending improvement measures, which were presented to the CEO and company team.
3. Effectively led a team of three members to successfully complete the data analysis project, achieving the 3rd place position in the Santa Clara University Data Competition.
